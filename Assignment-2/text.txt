Since 2016, RAS has been conducting interdisciplinary
research on the relation between the human mind,
architecture, aesthetics and new media forms to speculate
computational and representational concerns about
the perception of environment(s). These inquiries have
centred around a pioneering concept that emerged from
our art practice to become a research unit: Latent Cinema.
Thinking and producing at the intersection of AI, aesthetics
and architecture, the studio has been refl ecting on new
forms of narrating collective memory and history by
creating immersive spaces and interactive artworks that
would transform traditional understandings of the public
sphere. Experiments with synaesthesia, networked media
and interconnectivity through interactive, site-specifi c
installations are used to represent machine-based, latent
data universes in urban locations that enable deliberation
on what media art scholars Janine Marchessault and Susan
Lord call ‘cinema’s expanding architectures’.
